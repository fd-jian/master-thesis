## Abstract
Big Data and learning analytics increase their influence in modern education with the aim to create ubiquitous learning environments. With the rise of technology in our lives and, therefore, in the learning space of students, engagement in learning activities becomes an increasingly important task.  Detecting levels of engagement to be able to perform targeted interventions could be a promising approach to increase productivity. But the collection and evaluation of multimodal data from learning environments poses many infrastructural, ethical and legal challenges.

This thesis covers design and implementation of a learning analytics infrastructure on which real-time engagement detection and targeted intervention can be performed in the future. A suitable architecture was designed, relevant technologies and protocols evaluated in terms of the requirements and the core of the system was implemented, leaving analytical processing and engagement detection open for future projects. Security and privacy implications of such an infrastructure were evaluated to properly address them during implementation. It was concluded that not only privacy and data security is a challenging task, considering the sensitive data that is managed, but that specifically the involvement of smartphones and smartwatches may pose a privacy threat due to the proprietary nature of the operating systems and software. Finally, a performance evaluation was conducted for the developed system, resulting that the system meets the performance requirements of the use case.
